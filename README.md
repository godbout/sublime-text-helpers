# Personal snippets and macros for Sublime Text 3

After some time spent with various IDE, I got tired of waiting and spending ages debugging extensions and tools so I'm back to a minimalist environment that just has what I need
and works at the speed of light. Hello ST3 again. I build and use the snippets and macros I need and that's it. Please use them if they're useful to you.
